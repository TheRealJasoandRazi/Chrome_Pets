# Chrome_Pets
A chrome extensions that allows the user to displays and interact with digital pets

### Current Features ###
This extension involves a selection of pets, such as a duck and kanagaroo that moves around the user's web browser. When clicked, the user pets the duck where the duck will display heart emojis in return

### Future Features ###
In the feature we aim to have a larger collection of pets that can be selected instead of just a duck and kangaroo. In addition, future interactions with your pet will be added, such as feeding, dragging the pet and taking it for a walk. We also aim to have a few customisable features such as, changing the size of the pet and adding items such as hats on the pet.
