# Chrome_Pets
A chrome extensions that allows the user to displays and interact with digital pets

### Current Features ###
This extension involves a duck that moves around the user's web browser. When clicked, the user pets the duck where the duck will display heart emojis in return

### Future Features ###
In the feature we aim to have a collection of pets that can be selected instead of just a duck. In addition, future interactions with your pet will be added, such as feeding, dragging the pet and taking it for a walk. We also aim to create a pet home, where the user can customise and decoration the home of the pet.
